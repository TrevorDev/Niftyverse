# Niftyverse ![Niftyverse]()
Niftyverse is a collection of web VR/AR/XR views for every websites on the internet.
## How to use
  - Install the extension for your browser of choice: [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/extensions/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions?hl=en) or [Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/4027935/microsoft-edge-extensions)
  - Go to a webpage that is currently supported (eg. google.com)
  - Observe that the extension icon lights up
  - Click the extension and view the website in 3D
  - If you have a Hololens, Mixed-reality headset, Vive, Oculus, etc. put it on and experience the new web!
## How it works
Similar to adblock extensions which parse a webpage and removes content that a user does not want to see based on a list that contributers create, Niftyverse parses a webpage and adds/removes on the page so that the website can be viewed in 3D!

## Browser Vendor Request
If you are contribute to a browser or webstandards here are the demands:
 - WebVR/WebVR2.0/WebXR implemented in every browser
 - Ability for a user to allow a website to automatically enter VR without their action (Currently browsers force users to click)
 - WebVR composition!!!! Multitasking webVR is key to replace standard browser usage
 - WebVR composition on top of VR shells so that multitasking is supported with native apps (See [Niftykick Paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JzxKqir57c4RnpHhpH8nED8CRY7APwZqmYLlYzYcS-I/edit))

I've already started forking firefox to try to implement these features so if anyone wants to contribute to that let me know.
